The user has 6 tries to guess a 5-letter word. For each guess the user makes, the letters will either appear green (correct letter in the correct place), yellow (correct letter in the wrong place), or grey (wrong letter in the wrong place). The goal is to guess the word correctly.

This was an opportunity to create a JavaFX GUI application using various UI controls, layout management, and UI event handling.
