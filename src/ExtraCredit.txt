I implemented 3 things that I believe deserve extra credit:
	1. The ability to account for duplicate characters. 
	2. 3 different graphic animations at the top of the window. One says Jordle as default, the other two are victory and defeat depending on the outcome of the game.
	3. Controls: The rows that have not been reached are disabled. Once a row has been entered, it is disabled. Even though the opacity of disabled rows changes, boxes
		that are green or yellow keep their color opacity for clarity. The focus automatically shifts to the next row.
		Entering non-letters does nothing. If a letter is pressed, it puts it in the box and the focus automatically shifts to the next box. If delete/backspace is
		pressed, the box is cleared and the focus automatically shifts to the previous box.
		Users can also click with the mouse on any box in the active row to shift focus instead of going in order.
	+. Overall clean UI. The elements are spaced and positioned in an elegant manner. All components fit in the window.

The code compiles and runs with only the javafx.controls module. 
	So the provided "javac --module-path javafx-sdk-11.0.2/lib/ --addmodules=javafx.controls FileName.java" should work hopefully.
